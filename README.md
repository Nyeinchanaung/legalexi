### Overview
- This research introduces a system for automating Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) generation. It integrates spaCy (Named Entity Recognition) and Legal-BERT for extracting key legal clauses and user intent, enhanced by a Qwen-7B model fine-tuned with LoRA on the ContractNLI dataset. The clauses are dynamically populated into NDA templates using Jinja2. Evaluation using BERTScore yielded high precision (81.47%), recall (78.69%), and F1 score (80.05%). The system demonstrates improved drafting efficiency, accessibility, and clause alignment.

### Key Highlights
#### Our Objective

Automate the creation of legally sound NDAs using NLP and machine learning techniques.

#### Pipeline Design

Extracts contract information and user intent using Legal-BERT and spaCy.

Fine-tuned Qwen-7B model performs clause-level legal reasoning.

Jinja2 templating engine assembles tailored NDAs dynamically.

#### Evaluation Results

Precision: 81.47%, Recall: 78.69%, F1 Score: 80.05%.

Demonstrates semantic accuracy and robust legal alignment.

#### Significance

Reduces drafting time and costs.

Enhances accessibility for individuals and businesses without legal expertise.

Advances automation of legal workflows through AI integration.
